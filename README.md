# bidirectional_visitorcount_and_RIFD_locking_system
version1
In this project we used
1.Arduino_UNO   (1)
2.IR_Sensor     (2)
3.LCD_Display   (1)
4.Breadboard    (1)
5.ServoMotor    (1)
6.RFID_set      (1)
7.Jumperwires   


In this project we had placed 2 IR sensors i.e (one for entry and another of exit) by this we can access the number of visitors were present in the hall so that we can get turn off the lights if no one was there in the hall and we had placed the RFID set up to the inside cabin so by scanning the valid card eligible persons can get into the cabin here it work as security purpose.
